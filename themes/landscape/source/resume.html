                <p>
                    Constantly exploring and learning about and evaluating new tools, technologies and strategies for solving software engineering
                    challenges. Today you’ll most often find me working with NodeJS. Tomorrow it may be C# on .NET Core,
                    Go, good ‘ol C++ or some yet-to-catch-on language or framework. I have no affinity to a given tool or
                    language and I’m always tinkering and dreaming up better ways to do "stuff".

                        <p>
                            I work across the Microsoft Teams organization identifying opportunities to improve developer productivity and product quality
                            and then lead teams to deliver those solutions. This culminates in an engineering system which
                            provides a low resistance path for engineers to deliver new treatments to our customers safely
                            and confidently. For a better idea of what I do, here are some of my recent projects:
                            <ul>
                                <li>- Phased deployment and feature flighting</li>
                                <li>- Deterministic package installation via Yarn &amp; VSTS feeds</li>
                                <li>- Instrumentation of our build, release, and version-control systems</li>
